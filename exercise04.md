# Exercise 4 - Adding files

1. Look git status for your directory, and paste the contents below

        git status

2. Using VS Code, the command line, or your favorite code editor, create a new file named `fruits.txt`.

3. Check your git status, and paste the contents here

On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be commited)
  	fruits.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present(use "git add" to track)


4. Add the new file to your index

        git add fruits.txt

5. Check git status again, and paste the contents below

On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
  	new file:   fruits.txt
